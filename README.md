# Automata
![logo](icons/Logo.png)
## Motivation
This simple python code is for a schoolproject where the goal was to use state oriented programming techniques to create a working automatas.  The idea behind this project is to generalise this idea and wrap the code in a website.  I acchieved this using the python documentation generator [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) which creates the website pretty much out of the box.

## Implementation
This python code is meant to be a lightweight addition to anyone toying with automatas.  It is not constructed for efficiency, memory or compute time wise, but is supposed to create a easy to use interface to build small automatas with.

## Features
The features this code provides is rudementary file parsing as well as a way to implement a easy to use automata.  Currently one is able to define variables, create connections in addition to saving and loading from and to txt files.  The script is easy to use and works right out the box - nothin other than python is needed to run the code (a html viewer is required for the documetation).
